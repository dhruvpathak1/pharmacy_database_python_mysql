## Project Overview
MediTrack is a pharmacy management software developed in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for database management. It helps pharmacists efficiently track medicines, medical instruments, customers, and orders while ensuring real-time status updates and seamless inventory handling.

## Features

- Customer/hospital login system to place and track orders.
- New account creation for customers and hospitals.
- Real-time database updates for accuracy and error reduction.

## Project Structure
- **Pharmacy Management System:** Detailed explanation of the user interface and user experience.
- **Database System Report:** Contains ER diagrams and table structures explaining database design.
- **Python & MySQL Code:** Source code files for the application and database scripts.

## Motivation
With the rapid development in the medical field, maintaining an up-to-date pharmacy management system is challenging yet essential. MediTrack simplifies this by automating inventory control, expiration monitoring, and order processing, ensuring efficient and error-free pharmacy operations.
